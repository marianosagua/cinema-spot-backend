/**
 * Regroups all API routes for the movie reservation system backend.
 *
 * This static method creates and configures an Express Router by mounting various sub-route modules,
 * each handling specific functionalities of the system. The modular design assigns unique URL prefixes
 * to each group of routes, ensuring a clean and organized API structure.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The integrated sub-routes include:
 * - "/api/auth": Manages authentication operations.
 * - "/api/roles": Controls user roles and permissions.
 * - "/api/movies": Handles movie-related data and operations.
 * - "/api/showtimes": Manages scheduling for movie showtimes.
 * - "/api/reservations": Handles reservation processes.
 * - "/api/seats": Manages seating arrangements and related endpoints.
 * - "/api/rooms": Oversees room configuration and management.
 * - "/api/users": Manages user-related functionalities.
 *
 * @example
 * The following example shows how to incorporate the app routes into an Express application:
 *
 * import express from "express";
 * import { AppRoutes } from "./presentation/app.routes";
 *
 * const app = express();
 * app.use(AppRoutes.getRoutes());
 *
 * @returns {Router} A fully configured Express Router instance with all mounted API routes.
